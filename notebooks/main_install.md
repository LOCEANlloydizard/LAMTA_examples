# Installation and setup

These notebooks assume that **LAMTA is already installed** in your Python environment.

In particular:
- `import lamta` must work (if not, see [here](https://lamta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)),
- LAMTA must be installed **in the same environment** that will be used to run the notebooks.

This repository does **not** install LAMTA automatically.
